          <p>
          The focus of this course is on techniques for making robots
          intelligent enough to be able to assist humans. This topic
          constitutes a very active area of research in academia as well as
          industry, with multiple academic and commercial organizations
          jumping in to explore and develop the potential of robots that help
          humans. We will learn advanced tools for robotics that empower autonomous systems such as self-driving cars and study how they can be extended to enable versatile assitive robots.
          </p>

          <h3>Overview</h3> <p>This course covers some of the recent advances in
          intelligent robotics, particularly focusing on aspects relating to the
          theory and practice of getting robots to reason about and accomplish
          assistive tasks in indoor environments.  Students will have the
          opportunity to learn how to use robotics simulators, and to gain an
          understanding of this active research area including topics from
          motion planning, perception, learning and reasoning under uncertainty
          with a special reference to mobile manipulation. Final projects will
          be used to apply the learned knowledge and test new ideas in
          simulation or on a physical robot.</p>
          <br />
           
          <h3>Course format</h3><p> The course is designed as a seminar class
          that will start with a brief recap of the fundamentals and move on to
          discussion and evaluation of prominent research papers. Students will
          play a key role in the selection of papers in the later half of the
          course. Weekly meetings will be organized as instructor and student
          led discussions of the selected papers.  A detailed schedule of 
           presentations will be developed with the students at the beginning
          of the semester. </p>



          <ptitle>Projects</ptitle> Students will propose and implement final projects. Given the
          challenging nature of the topic, students will have flexibility in the
          design and nature of projects, going from novel algorithmic solutions
          for subproblems to implementations of existing techniques on an
          application designed by the team. <br>

          <p>Project development will be an essential component and students
          will be guided from early stages of their projects. Project proposals
          will be due 6 weeks from the start of the course. Most projects are
          expected to be demonstrated using robotics simulators; exceptionally
          performing teams will get the opportunity to demonstrate their work on
          a physical robot towards the end of the semester.</p>
          <br />


          <h3>Grading and expectations</h3> <p>There will be no midterm or final
          exams. Each team will be expected to produce a final report with clear
          indications of each team member’s role in the project. Each student
          will submit critiques for a subset (to be determined) of the selected
          research papers and lead the discussion of at least one of the
          selected papers.  Grades will be assigned based on students' critiques
          and discussion-leads (30%), innovation in the final project’s design
          and implementation (35%) and final report (35%). </p>
          <br />
           
          <h3>Prerequisites</h3><p> 471 or 571 or Instructor’s Approval    </p>

          <br />

          <h3>Tentative Schedule</h3>
          <p>To be refined during the first few classes.</p>

          <br />
          <h3> Absence and Make-up Policies </h3>

          If a student is unable to present on a scheduled date due to extenuating circumstances, an arrangement will be made to reschedule their presentation. Accommodations will be made for religious observances provided that students notify the instructor at the beginning of the semester concerning those dates.  Students who expect to miss class due to officially university-sanctioned activities should inform the instructor early in the semester.  Alternative arrangements will generally be made for any examinations and other graded in-class work affected by such absences. The preceding policies are based on ACD 304–04, “Accommodation for Religious Practices” and ACD 304–02, “Missed Classes Due to University-Sanctioned Activities.”
          <br /><br />


          <h3>Classroom Behavior</h3> Cell phones and pagers must be turned off
          during class to avoid causing distractions, unless instructed by the
          presenters (e.g., for online polling software).  The use of recording
          devices is not permitted during class.  Any violent or threatening
          conduct by an ASU student in this class will be reported to the ASU
          Police Department and the Office of the Dean of Students.
          <br /><br />


          <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
          All students in this class are subject to ASU’s Academic Integrity Policy (available at http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity) and should acquaint themselves with its content and requirements, including a strict prohibition against plagiarism.  All violations will be reported to the Dean’s office, who maintain records of all offenses.  Students are expected to abide by the FSE Honor Code (http://engineering.asu.edu/integrity/).
          <br /><br />

          <h3>Disability Accommodations</h3>
          Suitable accommodations will be made for students having disabilities and students should notify the instructor as early as possible if they will require same.  Such students must be registered with the Disability Resource Center and provide documentation to that effect.
          <br /><br />

          <h3>Sexual Discrimination</h3>
          Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis of sex from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity.  Both Title IX and university policy make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on sex is prohibited.  An individual who believes they have been subjected to sexual violence or harassed on the basis of sex can seek support, including counseling and academic support, from the university.  If you or someone you know has been harassed on the basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information and resources at https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs.  

          As a mandated reporter, I am obligated to report any information I become aware of regarding alleged acts of sexual discrimination, including sexual violence and dating violence.  ASU Counseling Services, https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling, is available if you wish discuss any concerns confidentially and privately.
